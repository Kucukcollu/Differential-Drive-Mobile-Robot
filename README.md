Differential Drive Mobile Robot Project via Data Logging.

### [Mobile Robot](https://github.com/Kucukcollu/Differential-Drive-Mobile-Robot/blob/master/MobileRobot.ino)

In the Mobile Robot circuit an SD card recorder was used to store LDR value, velocity state and motor velocity. The related 
datas were recorded in Excel format and velocity of mobile robot would be modified according to LDR value. To control robot, 
a mobile device or a tablet should be used. Communication was established by Bluetooth.
