Differential Drive Mobile Robot Project via Data Logging.

### [Mobile Robot](https://github.com/Kucukcollu/Differential-Drive-Mobile-Robot/blob/master/MobileRobot.ino)

In the Mobile Robot circuit a SD card recorder was used to store LDR value, velocity state and motor velocity. Therefore,
velocity of mobile robot would be modified according to LDR value. To control robot, a mobile device or a tablet should be
used. Communication was established by Bluetooth.
